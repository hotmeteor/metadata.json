metadata.json, a better way for browsers to handle meta tags.
=============================================================

## Why metadata.json?
Metatags have been around for a long time, and traditionally were the source of important information about a website for search engines and browsers. Things like author information, favicons, and language definitions were defined with metatags.

However, as more and more browsers on a myriad of devices come online, vendors continue to add specialized "metatags" to define device-specific data. Think icons, tiles, app behaviours, etc.

The time has come to rethink this system and attempt make metatags simpler and more unified. Of course, like all things on the web, this will take a cooperative effort first by developers and then by browser vendors.
